This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common error when checking for empty strings: using `length` instead of direct string comparison.  The `bug.pl` script shows the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected solution.  The error can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with strings that may contain whitespace but not be considered 'empty' by a simple length check. The solution highlights the importance of directly comparing the string against the empty string literal for accurate emptiness checks.
